## 2.1
Docker compose file that mounts the file can be found [here](projects/2_1/docker-compose.yml). When logs.txt file exists, it can be run with ```docker-compose up``` command.

## 2.2
Docker compose file that is used to run the service in port 80 can be found [here](projects/2_2/docker-compose.yml). 

## 2.3
Docker compose file for running both bakcend and frontend can be found [here](projects/2_3/docker-compose.yml). Since I put the environment variables to docker-compose.yml, I was able to remove them from the Dockerfiles.

## 2.4
